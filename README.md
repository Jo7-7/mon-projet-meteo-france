# Weather Forecasting and Climate Analytics using Machine Learning

This project aims to forecast weather conditions (temperature, rainfall, humidity, or air quality index) using machine learning techniques and analyze historical climate patterns with insightful visualizations.

## 📌 Objectives:
- Forecast future weather conditions using predictive analytics.
- Analyze historical climate patterns.
- Visualize and interpret climate trends.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack:
- Python
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- Scikit-Learn, Statsmodels, Prophet
- TensorFlow (Optional for Deep Learning)
